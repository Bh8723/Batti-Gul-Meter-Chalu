## Project Overview
This project is an advanced electrical surveillance robot capable of navigating the BITS Goa campus, analyzing power machinery, and identifying regions of electrical failure. The robot integrates mechanical, electronics, and automation systems to achieve autonomous navigation and task execution.

## Repository Structure
- **Mechanical:** Contains the CAD files and necessary documentations.
- **Electronics:** Includes thePCB design.
- **Automation:** Holds the ROS2 package for path planning, control, and cone detection.
- **Documentation:** A comprehensive report and additional references.

## Task Breakdown
### Mechanical Design

## Suspension:
Shock absorbers for each wheel.

## Rear Wheels:
Airless wheels for internal damping and shock absorbance.
Also durable and capable of traversing in rocky terrain where aired wheels may get punctured.
Significantly larger in size than the front wheels to help in providing enough push while climbing stairs.

## Front Wheels:
Dolly system incorporated for stair climbing.
Smaller wheels used for decreased weight to easily create toppling effect with the push from rear wheels.

## Body:
Hollow body to place all the electronics and keep it safe from extreme conditions.
Made of light materials like carbon fiber to decrease the overall weight of the the robot.

## Robotic Arm:
A standard 3 DOF robotic arm to reach the region of requirement easily.
Mounted on a 360Â° base to increase the mobility of the arm.

## Areas of Further Improvement:

- Incorporate a toolbox in the body to help the robotic arm with basic repair work.
- Incorporate a scissor lift to help the arm reach vertical heights.
- Incorporate a rubber track on the underside of the body to increase grip while climbing stairs.
